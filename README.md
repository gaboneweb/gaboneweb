### Hi there 👋

I'm Bulelani, a final-year student at WeThinkCode_ with a passion for solving problems and building clean, maintainable software.

🔭 Currently, I'm focused on:
- 🐍 Python and ☕ Java
- Basics of CI/CD pipelines
- 🗃️ Basic SQL and SQLite
- Learning web development with HTML, CSS, Flask, and Javalin

👯 I enjoy collaborating with others and working in teams. I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and grow as a software developer.
